<p>The purpose of <b>Nervatura Project</b> is to develop such data model,
	tools and knowledge database which allows to build safe and flexible
	management solutions quickly and at low cost. The outcome of the
	project is primarily for use of developers and firms that provide
	management service but surely it can be useful for any company for its
	own management improvements.</p>
<p>The project consists of several sub-projects which are all based on
	Nervatura’s own object model and intended to support its use for
	various applications. The developments are open-source projects -
	except some dedicated applications - and can be used freely under the
	scope of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html" target="_blank">LGPLv3

			<span class="sname">NOM</span>&nbsp;<b>Nervatura Object Model</b>
	</a>&nbsp;
		<p>
			General data model, which can store all information generated during
			the operation of a classic organization. 
			<a class="w2p_trap buttontext button" title="{{=T('More info')}}"
				onclick="var tb=document.getElementById('mom'); if(tb.style.display == 'none'){tb.style.display = 'block';} else {tb.style.display = 'none'}">
				<span class="icon plus"></span></a> 
			<div id="mom" style="display: none;">
			<p>This includes all manufacturer, retailer and service companies (or
				government units) which operation can be defined and described
				within a GOODS (we want to sell or we supply) – CLIENT (we work for)
				- RESOURCE (we possess for the task) triangle.</p>
			<p>It is located between the applications, surfaces that are using
				and creating the data and the real data storage layer. It defines
				logical objects; data is stored in these freely defined attributes
				and in relations between them. Its flexible structure allows
				defining new properties or assigning events to our objects.</p>
			<p>Mainly it was created with the aim to support developers in
				focusing on the presentation layer i.e. an efficient and easy to use
				user interface. There is no need for special database planning
				knowledge and time saving benefit is gained. Though, they are
				provided with a safe, scalable (flexibly following the increasing
				data storage need and potential complexity) and easy to port
				(database independent) device for data storage.</p>
			<p>Other point of view was to realize an important management
				development principle. Namely, to separate the management
				applications from data generated in certain processes. The purpose
				is to ensure that companies using the applications have complete
				access to their own data in all cases. The physical possession of a
				database is not a sufficient to reach this goal. The possibility of
				proper interpretation and availability for further usage of stored
				data must also be ensured.</p>
			<p>Data stored in the <b>NOM</b> are independent from the applications
				that are using them. This also means that in this sense the programs
				written for <b>NOM</b> are also compatible with each other. This ensures
				the easy change not only between two identical programs of the same
				role. Companies having NOM can easily use variety of applications
				written for different platforms (PC, mobile devices, data
				gatherings, etc) and different technologies (HTML5, java, flash,
				traditional programming languages, etc) in order to support their
				processes.</p>

      <p>Data of usage rights/levels and proper database access settings
				are stored here. Further database independent, user or application
				level functions can also be implemented here.<br>
				The <b>NAS</b> doesn’t store
				data related to workflow management but information needed for
				accessing these data. The client databases, server databases can
				also be placed here but those can be located anywhere else in the
				world as well.</p>
			<p>The <b>NAS</b> is based on the <a
          href="http://www.web2py.com/" target="_blank">WEB2PY WEB
          FRAMEWORK</a> technology and
				uses its security solutions. Through handling databases of WEB2PY
				DAL it supports numerous drivers such as SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL,
				MSSQL. Each of them can be chosen for data storage and the
				types can also be exchanged at any time. In Nervatura applications
				the data access is independent from the type of storage.</p>
			<p>The support for user interfaces of server settings is part of
				<b>NAS</b> project. For instance: setting of certain user rights or
				database accesses. Remote access of that could be limited because of
				safety reasons.</p>

			The purpose was to create an easy to learn, simple and safe function

			query or transmit information to a Nervatura client database for any
			purpose.

				migration, sending or receiving data to or from other applications
				(for instance accounting systems, analytical data supply, etc), data
				source for analytical reports, loading data from offline

			<p>Main advantages and specifics of usage:	
			<ul>
				<li>The structure of functions is tracking the logic of
					workflow management, it’s not necessary to recognize and understand
					the data storage principles and exact structure of the database.</li>
				<li>The functions can easily be called from anywhere with any
					device or programming language embedded in http requests which are
					optionally encoded and encrypted.</li>
				<li>Several format types can be called as results of queries
					such as text, html table, xml, excel.</li>
				<li>Update for functions is centrally provided in case of
					potential database changes, also backward compatibility is
					assured. It makes it easy to maintain the automated tasks as no
					further resources are needed for updates.</li>
				<li>During entering new data, the <b>NOM</b> object attribute -which
					has not existed before- is automatically generated when the first
					value is given.</li>
				<li>With <b>NDI</b> data integrity problems can be avoided when
					inserting or updating data, which means the queried information is
					certainly composed well and the uploaded data stored properly. The
					built-in rule system also indicates the logical errors.</li>
